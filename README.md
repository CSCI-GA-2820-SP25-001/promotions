NYU DevOps project for managing **Promotions** in an e-commerce platform. This service provides RESTful APIs for managing discounts, special offers, and promotions.

## Overview

This is a **Promotions Service** for managing discounts in an e-commerce platform. It allows users to create, update, delete, and track various promotions such as:
- âœ… **Percentage discounts**
- âœ… **Buy-One-Get-One (BOGO) offers**
- âœ… **Flat rate discounts ($10 off, etc.)**
- ðŸš§ **Query filters for promotions (upcoming)**
- ðŸš§ **Stateful actions on promotions (upcoming)**

## Introduction
As Software Engineers, it's crucial to test and ensure code stability. You can learn more about this in the article: [A Case for Test Driven Development](https://johnrofrano.medium.com/a-case-for-test-driven-development-7d9a552e0a16)

## ðŸ“Œ Prerequisite Software Installation

This project uses **Docker** and **Visual Studio Code with Remote Containers** for consistent development environments.

Install the following:
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Remote Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

Alternatively, use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for virtual environments. More info in [Creating Reproducible Development Environments](https://johnrofrano.medium.com/creating-reproducible-development-environments-fac8d6471f35).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Bring up the Development Environment

### ðŸš€ Start Developing with Visual Studio Code and Docker

1. **Clone and navigate into the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
```

2. **Launch Visual Studio Code**:

```bash
code .
```

3. When prompted to **"Reopen in Container"**, select **"Yes"**.

This will build your containerized environment automatically.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Running the Service

### Option 1: Run Locally (without Docker)

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Start the Flask app**:
```bash
flask run
```

The service will run at: **http://localhost:5000/**

### Option 2: Running with Docker

Use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The service will be available at **http://localhost:5000/** (unless specified otherwise).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Running Tests

Run tests before any code changes to confirm all existing functionality works:

```bash
make test
```

To run linting for code quality:

```bash
make lint
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET`    | `/promotions`         | List all promotions |
| `POST`   | `/promotions`         | Create a new promotion |
| `GET`    | `/promotions/{id}`    | Get a specific promotion |
| `PUT`    | `/promotions/{id}`    | Update a promotion |
| `DELETE` | `/promotions/{id}`    | Delete a promotion |
| ðŸš§ `GET`  | `/promotions?type=BOGO`| Query promotions by type (upcoming) |
| ðŸš§ `PUT` | `/promotions/{id}/activate` | Activate a promotion (upcoming) |

---

## ðŸ“Œ Shutdown Development Environment

### Using Docker
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Using Vagrant
```bash
exit
vagrant halt
```
To remove VM:
```bash
vagrant destroy
```
